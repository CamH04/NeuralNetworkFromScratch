# Matrices (Maths)
Vectors

(2 \* 1) + (3 \* 5) + (2 \* 2) = \[2 3 2\] . \[1 5 2\]

       ^--- dot product

dot product is multiplying all values and then getting the sum of all those values

eg . (2 \* 1) + (3 \* 5) + (2 \* 2) = 21

Matrices are 2d vectors

*   When you think of a scalar, think of a **single number.**
*   When you think of a vector, think of a **list of numbers.**
*   When you think of a matrix, think of a **table of numbers**.

Matrices make doing alot of calculations simple to express

*   first number does top row of 2nd matrix and 2nd number does 2nd row of that matrix 

more complicated one
