# Maths Stuff
1.  A dot product between two vectors returns a single number.
2.  For matrix multiplication, order matters.
3.  You can only multiply two matrices if the first matrix has dimensions **a x b**, and the second has dimensions **b x c**, resulting in a matrix with dimensions **a x c**.
4.  Transposing a matrix swaps its columns and rows. It makes a matrix with dimensions **a x b** turn into a matrix with dimensions **b x a**.
